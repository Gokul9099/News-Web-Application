        Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus and Mercury are the five planets in our solar system that are visible without the help of a telescope, but Mercury can be the most difficult of the bunch to spot.
        
        The tiny planet is often lost in the bright light from the sun, but several times a year, it appears in the evening or early morning sky. Even then, it is typically very dim and can be hard to spot.</td>
